Zombie mode is a cooperative game mode where you and up to three other players have to survive waves of zombies in different maps. You can use various weapons, perks, and power-ups to fight off the undead horde. Zombie mode was originally featured in Call of Duty World at War, but it was revamped and included in Call of Duty Black Ops as well.
 
To play zombie mode on PC, you will need to have Call of Duty Black Ops installed on your computer. You will also need to download the file "B.ops.z.mode Xtrem.rar" from MediaFire[^1^]. This file contains three files that you need to copy and paste into your Call of Duty Black Ops main installation folder. The main installation folder is usually located at C:/Program Files/Activision/Call Of Duty Black Ops.
 
Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the file "B.ops.z.mode Xtrem.rar" from MediaFire[^1^]. The link is: [http://www.mediafire.com/?cd3p9xsyjxuogx1](http://www.mediafire.com/?cd3p9xsyjxuogx1)
